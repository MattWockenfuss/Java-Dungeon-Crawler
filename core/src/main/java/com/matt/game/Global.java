            Todo

        Make Light less sharp, especially on sides, add some sort of gradient for horizontal distance from center
        maybe make a triangle for every vertex and factor a gradient based on distance from point light

        Add Rectangular light Source

        Create a new Lightbox collision layer

        For all light sources, check the lit region for intersection of light hitboxes
        see redblobgames 2d lighting

        Somehow fix the walls?
        Procedural World Generation
            A Variety of room types
            Doors
            Decorations in those rooms that has collision
            spike traps? idk
            beable to save the world to a file and load it later

            Maybe be able to select a world size? Or make it infinite

        Add Entities
            implement all of the different slimes that I made and them some
            Atleast 40 different slimes (they all move the same, maybe they have slightly different attributes)

            maybe add a boss room type in the dungeon with a giant slime, like the size of a room, and he has spikes all around him
            if you touch him u die maybe
            He has a bunch of little slime minions


        Add Cameras, with a green tint when u are looking through them in the shader

            Maybe They can vary in size
            maybe some of them are very large and fat and they have a giant american flag and a gun

            maybe some of them shoot something at you
            maybe some of them try to find others of the same type and merge

            maybe one of them change colors based on how close you are
            maybe the miner slime drops a better flashlight


            Maybe one of the slimes listens for the first audio it hears of pretty good volume and length and it just repeats it

            Bonus: one listens to you and your conversation, feeds to chatGPT generates something to say, then feeds it to barack obama talk and downloads
            to server in real time

            maybe one of them attacks another slime and they hate each other
            maybe one of them steals the item you are holding
            obviously one hears u threw walls
            maybe one of them is blind but follows your voice


            Maybe one of them blocks light
            maybe one of them gives off light
            maybe one of them is a sound block hole
            maybe one of them doesnt move when you look at them
            maybe one of them makes you really slow when your in their vision
            maybe one of them is really small but fast
            maybe one of them likes to block doors
            maybe one of them likes so hang around a certain player
            maybe of them doesnt hurt you, but links up with others like him and forms walls
            maybe one of them is good and follows you but gives off light
            maybe one type of them is a hive mind
            maybe one type of them plays crab rave
            maybe one of them is dead silent
